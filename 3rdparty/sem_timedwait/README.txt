sem_timedwait.c is an implementation of sem_timedwait() on OSX.

Originally from here (link is now dead):

There are other copies floating around like here:
  https://github.com/attie/libxbee3/blob/master/xsys_darwin/sem_timedwait.c

Since the original source is dead, instead of mirroring and submoduling the
entire libxbee3 repo, we just include a copy of the source here.
