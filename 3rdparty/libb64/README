Patch: newline.patch

Base64 is commonly used as a text encoding for binary data in MIME encapsulated formats,
which according to RFC 2646 recommends that lines not be longer than 72 characters and
that they should end with a newline.

When encoding base64 for HTTP, newlines are undesirable, and we're not encoding for MIME,
so we don't have a 72 character limit.

This patch adds a parameter to enable/disable the behaviour of adding a newline every 72
characters and at end of line.
