lwIP doesn't come with any Makefiles or other build scripts.

This folder contains everything needed to build lwIP,
adapted from some samples in lwip-contrib, an external repo.

Files and folders:

lwip/           - The lwIP source tree.

lwipopts.h      - Main lwIP configuration header.
                  This is copied to lwip/src/include/lwipopts.h

                  In our configuration we directly use the low-level callback-based API,
                  which doesn't need any threads or synchronization.

                  See: http://lwip.wikia.com/wiki/Application_API_layers
                  and: lwip/doc/rawapi.txt

arch_cc.h       - Defines basic types and macros used by lwIP.
                  This is copied to lwip/src/include/arch/cc.h

sys_arch.c      - Implements threads and synchronization primitives.
                  In our configuration, this only needs to implement sys_now()

CMakeLists.txt  - Builds just lwip/src/core and lwip/src/api

lwip-tags.patch - Patch to add socket tags to lwIP's TCP stack.
                  Generated using the following command in the lwip/ source folder:
                  git diff --no-prefix --ignore-submodules > ../lwip-tags.patch
